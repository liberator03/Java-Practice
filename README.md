# Java Programming Concepts

## ðŸ“š Hereâ€™s What Weâ€™ve Covered

| **Topic**                | **What I Learned**                                                           | **Code Example**                                                   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Data Types**      | Getting familiar with basic types like `int`, `String`, `double`, `boolean`.   | `String name = "Mukund"; int age = 21;`                            |
| **Variables & Operators** | Learning how to declare variables and perform operations.                     | `int addition = age + height;`                                     |
| **Control Flow**          | Using `if`, `else if`, `else` and loops (`for`, `while`) to control flow.     | `if (score >= 90) { System.out.println("Excellent"); }`             |
| **Switch Case**           | Using `switch` when I have multiple options to choose from.                   | `switch(day) { case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break; }`     |
| **Arrays**                | Working with arrays and looping through them like a pro.                      | `int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};`                                      |
| **Methods**               | Writing methods to do tasks and keep things organized.                        | `public static void greetUser() { System.out.println("Hello!"); }` |
| **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** | Getting into classes, objects, and organizing code neatly.       | `class Book { String title; void displayInfo() { System.out.println("Info"); } }` |
| **Constructors**          | Special methods that set things up when I create an object.                   | `public Book(String title) { this.title = title; }`                |
| **`this` Keyword**        | Using `this` to refer to the current instance of the class.                   | `this.title = title;`                                              |
| **Encapsulation**         | Keeping fields private and using getters/setters for controlled access.      | `private String title; public String getTitle() { return title; }` |
| **Setters & Getters**     | Creating methods to safely set and get private field values.                  | `public void setTitle(String title) { this.title = title; }`       |
| **Classes & Objects**     | Understanding how to create classes and objects to use in my program.         | `Book b = new Book("Title", "Author");`                             |

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Coming Up?

- **Inheritance** â€” Iâ€™ll learn how one class can inherit from another.
- **Polymorphism** â€” Overloading and overriding methods like a boss.
- **Abstraction** â€” Hiding the complex stuff and showing just whatâ€™s needed.

## ðŸ’¡ Wrap-Up

Iâ€™ve covered all the basics now! From variables to methods, control flow to OOP principles â€” Iâ€™m building a strong foundation in Java. Time to keep practicing and level up my skills! ðŸŽ¯ðŸš€
