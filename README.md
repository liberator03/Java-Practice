# Java Programming Journey: From Basics to OOP Mastery

Welcome to my Java learning journey! This repo chronicles the concepts I've learned from scratch, progressing from basic syntax to advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## üìö What I‚Äôve Learned

| **Concept**                          | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Syntax**                     | Started with basic syntax: variables, data types, operators, and simple methods. |
| **Conditionals & Loops**             | Mastered if-else, switch-case, and loop constructs (for, while, do-while).       |
| **Arrays**                           | Explored arrays and iteration methods (for-each, for-loop).                     |
| **Methods**                          | Created custom methods for various operations (addition, subtraction).          |
| **Objects & Classes**                | Created classes and objects to model real-world entities.                       |
| **Constructors**                     | Learned constructors for initializing objects and using the `this` keyword.     |
| **Encapsulation**                    | Introduced private variables and getter/setter methods to protect data.         |
| **Inheritance**                      | Inherited properties from a parent class and extended functionality in child classes. |
| **Method Overriding**                | Overrode methods from parent classes to provide child-specific behavior.        |
| **Polymorphism**                     | Used polymorphism to have different objects respond to the same method in unique ways. |
| **Abstract Classes & Interfaces**    | Introduced abstract classes and interfaces for blueprint-style design.          |
| **`super` Keyword**                  | Used `super` to call parent class methods and constructors.                     |
| **`final` Keyword**                  | Applied the `final` keyword to restrict modification of methods, variables, and classes. |
| **Real-World Modeling**              | Integrated all OOP concepts to model real-world scenarios effectively.          |

## üìù Assignments Completed

| **Assignment**                        | **Concept Focused**                                    |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| [Calculator](src/Assignment/Assignment1.java)      | Methods, basic operations                              |
| [Student Info](src/Assignment/Assignment2.java)    | Methods, data types                                    |
| [Array Analysis](src/Assignment/Assignment3.java)  | Arrays, loops, conditionals                            |
| [FizzBuzz](src/Assignment/Assignment4.java)        | Loops, conditionals                                    |
| [Greet by Time](src/Assignment/Assignment5.java)   | Conditionals, time-based logic                         |

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Next?

With a solid foundation in OOP, I‚Äôm now ready to dive deeper into advanced Java concepts like:

- **Abstract Classes & Interfaces** ‚Äî More powerful ways to design reusable code.
- **Polymorphism & Method Overloading** ‚Äî Making my methods even more dynamic.
- **The `super` and `final` keywords** ‚Äî To refine and restrict code where needed.

Stay tuned for more as I explore the full potential of Java and build some powerful, real-world applications!
